# General Assembly SEI Final Project â€˜An Exquisite Corpseâ€™ ðŸŽ¨

## Technical Brief:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making the Front and Back-end.
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database.
* **Consume your API with a separate Frontend** built with React.
* **Deploy your app online.** Make it publicly accessible.
* **Time Frame**: 7 days.

## Technologies:

* JavaScript
* React.js
* Python
* Django
* Konva.js & HTML Canvas
* CSS & Semantic UI
* Heroku (deployment)

## Overview:

As my final project for the General Assembly SEI course, I chose to make a drawing app using Konva.js inside of a React project to work with HTML canvas. The app is full-stack, with a Django back-end.

The basic concept is for the user to take part in creating an [â€˜Exquisite Corpseâ€™](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse) drawing, a simple drawing game in which someone draws a head, folds the paper, then passes it to someone else who draws the body, then again to someone else to draw the legs. When unfolded, it reveals a unique/weird/funny composition of a whole person/animal/thing.

The user chooses to draw a part of the body (head, body or feet). Once completed, they are presented with a full drawing composed of their image combined with randomly generated drawings from previous users. Their original drawing would then be saved to the back-end and used in future users compositions.

The app requires a user to make an account before being able to submit a drawing or view the rest of the database however a viewer can still see a randomly generated example of a full drawing without logging in.

After researching various ways to use HTML canvas techniques to build the drawing functionality, I ended up using [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/) as it seemed to be more adaptable to React than some of the other options like [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).


## Challenges:
Learning to use a completely new library like Konva and having never used HTML canvas at all prior to starting this project, it was a **lot** to take on board in a very short space of time, so the learning curve was quite steep when working out how to turn the idea into a functioning app.

It was really rewarding when those parts started coming together though and I began to get more comfortable trying different ideas and being more creative with my code as it progressed.
